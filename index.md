## Welcome to the EECS 494 Metroid Template Tutorial Series

In these tutorials, we will walk you through some initial steps to get your classic game remake started.

As you go through these tutorials, make sure you're following along in your own project so that by the end you'll be  setup and ready to tackle the project on your own.

We expect these tutorials to take approximately 1 hour to complete, but they are sectioned so that you can stop and review at any time.

When you're ready to get started, go to the first tutorial: [1: Project and Scene.](./01-Project-and-Scene)
