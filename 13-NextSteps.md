## Next Steps

You've made it through the tutorial! Hopefully you learned a lot about Unity development along the way. At the very least you're now well on your way into the **Metroid** project.

If you haven't done so already, you should play through the original **Metroid**, taking detailed notes along the way to get an idea of what will be required.

<p>In the words of some Dark Souls elitists: "Get Good"</p>
<p>That or use an emulator that has save states. That's what I did</p>

[There is a list of what's expected to be done here]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xh1qqKgpKQuK0o_wfihxVVl7m4TRGO55rwoX7OcEn5s/"), but note that this is intentionally vague to require you to figure things out on your own.

There's a big difference between having something done and having something done well. Even if something seems minor to you, like setting the speed of an enemy appropriately, know that it can make or break how your game plays.

In a broad sense, the more your game feels like the original, the better you'll do.

As far as how you approach the project: that's up to you. We reccomend you hash out most of the functionality first, clean up your implementations second, and add aesthetics last.

Whatever you do, make sure that you and your partner are on page and tackling the most important issues.

# Good luck!
